# Generator functions use yield instead of return

# The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to the caller, 
# but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, 
# the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows 
# its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once 
# and sending them back like a list.
